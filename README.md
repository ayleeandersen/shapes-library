# shapes-library
The purpose of this project was to make an extendable shapes library. I was provided with starter code
that was not modular or abstract. I was tasked with rewriting the library so that it followed the 
Open/Closed Principle (open for extension, closed for modification). In addition to refactoring the starter 
code, I added several more shapes. Two more complex shapes were the composite shapes and embedded pictures. This 
repository focuses on demonstrating the usage of the composite shapes and embedded pictures in the shapes library.
